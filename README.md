# QA_Project

Initial Plan on making a school enrollment program, idea generated from work done with QA in the program so far

Setting up the data bases will consist of Students, Enrollment and classes

ERD demonstates relationships between the tables with a one to many relation ship between students and enrollment and classes
this would make enrollment a subclass only containing foreign keys of students and classes in turn forming a many to many relationship between students and classes

Program will allow input of student details and class details and allow students to enroll on classes.
